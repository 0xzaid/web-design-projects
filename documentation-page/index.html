            <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Learn what React is all
                about on <a href="https://reactjs.org/">our homepage</a> or
                <a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html">in the tutorial</a>.
            </p>
            <h3>Try React</h3>
            <p>React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and <strong>you can use as little
                    or as much React as you need.</strong> Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some
                interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, the links in this section
                will help you get started.
            </p>
            <h3>Online Playgrounds</h3>
            <p>If you're interested in playing around with React, you can use an online code playground. Try a Hello
                World template on <a href="https://reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/hello-world">CodePen</a>,
                <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/new">CodeSandbox</a>, or <a href="https://stackblitz.com/fork/react">
                    Stackblitz</a>.<br>
            </p>

            <p>If you prefer to use your own text editor, you can also
                <a
                    href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/main/static/html/single-file-example.html">
                    download this HTML file</a>, edit it, and open it from the local filesystem in your browser. It does
                a slow
                runtime code transformation, so we’d only recommend using this for simple demos
            </p>

            <h3>Add React to a Website</h3>
            <p>You can <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html">add React to an HTML page in one
                    minute</a>. You can then either gradually expand its presence, or keep it contained to a few dynamic
                widgets.</p>

            <h3>Create a New React App</h3>
            <p>When starting a React project, a <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html">simple
                    HTML page with script tags</a> might still be the best option. It only takes a minute to set
                up!<br></p>

            <p>As your application grows, you might want to consider a more integrated setup. There are several
                JavaScript toolchains we recommend for larger applications. Each of them can work with little to
                no configuration and lets you take full advantage of the rich React ecosystem. <br>
                <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html">Learn how.</a>
            </p>
            <h3>Learn React</h3>
            <p>People come to React from different backgrounds and with different learning styles. Whether you
                prefer a more theoretical or a practical approach, we hope you’ll find this section helpful.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you prefer to <strong>learn by doing</strong>, start with our practical tutorial.</li>
                <li>If you prefer to <strong>learn concepts step by step</strong>, start with our guide to main
                    concepts.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Like any unfamiliar technology, React does have a learning curve. With practice and some patience,
                you will get the hang of it.</p>

            <h3>First Examples</h3>
            <p>The <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React homepage</a> contains a few small React examples with a
                live editor. Even if you don’t know anything about React yet, try changing their code and see how
                it affects the result.</p>

            <h3>React for Beginners</h3>
            <p>If you feel that the React documentation goes at a faster pace than you’re comfortable with, check
                out <a href="https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-react/">this overview of React by
                    Tania Rascia</a>. It introduces the most important React concepts in a detailed, beginner-friendly
                way. Once you’re done, give the documentation another try!</p>

            <h3>React for Designers</h3>
            <p>If you’re coming from a design background, <a href="https://reactfordesigners.com/">these resources</a>
                are a great place to get started.</p>

            <h3>JavaScript Resources</h3>
            <p>The React documentation assumes some familiarity with programming in the JavaScript language.
                You don’t have to be an expert, but it’s harder to learn both React and JavaScript at the
                same time.<br></p>
            <p>We recommend going through this JavaScript overview to check your knowledge level. It will
                take you between 30 minutes and an hour but you will feel more confident learning React.</p>

            <div class="tip">
                <h4>Tip</h4>
                <p>Whenever you get confused by something in JavaScript,
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">MDN</a> and
                    <a href="https://javascript.info/">javascript.info</a> are great websites to check. There
                    are also <a href="https://reactjs.org/community/support.html">community support forums</a>
                    where you can ask for help.

        <section class="main-section" id="Add_React_to_a_Website">
            <header>
                Add React to a Website
            </header>
            <p>React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and <strong>you can use as little or as
                    much React as you need.</strong> Perhaps you only want to add some “sprinkles of interactivity” to
                an existing page. React components are a great way to do that.<br></p>
            <p>The majority of websites aren’t, and don’t need to be, single-page apps. With a <strong>few lines of
                    code and no build tooling</strong>, try React in a small part of your website. You can then either
                gradually expand its presence, or keep it contained to a few dynamic widgets.</p>

            <h3>Add React in One Minute</h3>
            <p>In this section, we will show how to add a React component to an existing HTML page. You can follow
                along with your own website, or create an empty HTML file to practice.<br></p>
            <p>There will be no complicated tools or install requirements — <strong>to complete this section, you only
                    need an internet connection, and a minute of your time.</strong></p>

            <h3>Step 1: Add a DOM Container to the HTML</h3>
            <p>First, open the HTML page you want to edit. Add an empty
            <div> tag to mark the spot where you want
                to display something with React. For example:</p>

                <code class="language-html">&lt;div id="like_button_container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>

                <p>We gave this <span class="yellow">&lt;div&gt;</span> a unique <span class="yellow">id</span> HTML
                    attribute. This will allow us to find it from the JavaScript code later and display a React
                    component inside of it.</p>

                <div class="tip">
                    <h4>Tip</h4>
                    <p>You can place a “container” &lt;div&gt; like this <strong>anywhere</strong> inside the
                        &lt;body&gt;
                        tag. You may have as many independent DOM containers on one page as you need. They are usually
                        empty — React will replace any existing content inside DOM containers.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Step 2: Add the Script Tags</h3>
                <p>Next, add three <span class="yellow">&lt;script&gt;</span> tags to the HTML page right before the
                    closing &lt;/body&gt; tag:</p>

                <code class="language-html">
            &lt;!-- ... other HTML ... --&gt;<br>
            <br>
            &lt;!-- Load React. --&gt;<br>
            &lt;!-- Note: when deploying, replace "development.js" with "production.min.js". --&gt;<br>
            &lt;script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js" crossorigin>&lt;/script><br>
            &lt;script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js" crossorigin>&lt;/script><br>
            <br>
            &lt;!-- Load our React component. --&gt;<br>
            &lt;script src="like_button.js">&lt;/script><br>
            <br>
            &lt;/body&gt;
        </code>

                <p>The first two tags load React. The third one will load your component code.</p>

                <h3>Step 3: Create a React Component</h3>
                <p>Create a file called <span class="yellow">like_button.js</span> next to your HTML page.<br></p>

                <p>Open <strong><a href="https://gist.github.com/gaearon/0b180827c190fe4fd98b4c7f570ea4a8/raw/b9157
            ce933c79a4559d2aa9ff3372668cce48de7/LikeButton.js">this starter code</a></strong> and paste it
                    into the file you created.</p>

                <div class="tip">
                    <h4>Tip</h4>
                    <p>This code defines a React component called <span class="yellow">LikeButton</span>. Don’t worry
                        if you don’t understand it yet — we’ll cover the building blocks of React later in our
                        <a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html">hands-on tutorial</a> and
                        <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html">main
                            concepts guide</a>. For now, let’s just get it showing on the screen!
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>After the <strong><a href="https://gist.github.com/gaearon/0b180827c190fe4fd98b4c7f570ea4a8/raw/b9157
            ce933c79a4559d2aa9ff3372668cce48de7/LikeButton.js">starter code</a></strong>, add three lines to the
                    bottom of <span class="yellow">like_button.js:</span></p>

                <code>
            // ... the starter code you pasted ...<br>
            <br>
            const domContainer = document.querySelector('#like_button_container');<br>
            const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(domContainer);<br>
            root.render(e(LikeButton));<br>
        </code>

                <p>These lines of code find the <span class="yellow">&lt;div&gt;</span> we added to our HTML in the
                    first
                    step, and then display our “Like” button React component inside of it.</p>

                <h3>That's It!</h3>
                <p>There is no step four. <strong>You have just added the first React component to your website.</p>

            <header>Create a New React App</header>
            <p>This page describes a few popular React toolchains which help with tasks like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Scaling to many files and components.</li>
                <li>Using third-party libraries from npm.</li>
                <li>Detecting common mistakes early.</li>
                <li>Live-editing CSS and JS in development.</li>
                <li>Optimizing the output for production.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The toolchains recommended on this page <strong>don’t require configuration to get started.</strong></p>

            <h3>You Might Not Need a Toolchain</h3>
            <p>If you don’t experience the problems described above or don’t feel comfortable using JavaScript tools
                yet, consider <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html">adding React as a
                    plain &lt;script&gt; tag on an HTML page</a>, optionally

            </p>

            <h3>Create React App</h3>
            <p>Create React App is a comfortable environment for <strong>learning React</strong>, and is the best way to
                start building
                <strong>a new <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/glossary.html#single-page-application">single-page</a>
                    application</strong> in React.<br>
            </p>
            <p>It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a
                nice developer
                experience, and optimizes your app for production. You’ll need to have
                <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node >= 14.0.0 and npm >= 5.6</a> on your machine.
                To create a project, run:
            </p>

            <code>
                npx create-react-app my-app<br>
                cd my-app<br>
                npm start<br>
            </code>

        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
            <header>Hello World</header>
            <p>The smallest React example looks like this:</p>
            <code>
            const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));<br>
            root.render(&lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;);<br>

            <h3>How to Read This Guide</h3>
            <p>In this guide, we will examine the building blocks of React apps: elements and components. Once you
                master them, you can create complex apps from small reusable pieces.</p>

                Introducing JSX
            </header>
            <p>Consider this variable declaration:</p>
            <code>
            const element = &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;;<br>
            </code>
            <p>This funny tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML.<br></p>
            <p>
                It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to
                describe what the UI
                should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of
                JavaScript.<br>
            </p>
            <p>JSX produces React “elements”. We will explore rendering them to the DOM in the
                <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html">next section</a>. Below, you
                can find the basics of JSX necessary to get you started.
            </p>

            <h3>Why JSX?</h3>
            <p>React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how
                events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.</p>

            <p>Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files,
                React <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns"><em>separates concerns</em></a>
                with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both. We will
                come back to components in a <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html">further
                    section</a>,
                but if you’re not yet comfortable putting markup in JS,
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7cQ3mrcKaY">this talk</a> might convince you otherwise.<br>
            </p>

            <p>React <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html">doesn’t require</a> using JSX, but
                most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI
                inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.<br></p>

            <p>With that out of the way, let’s get started!</p>

            <h3>Embedding Expressions in JSX</h3>
            <p>In the example below, we declare a variable called <span class="yellow">name</span> and then use it
                inside JSX by wrapping it in curly braces:</p>
            <code>
            const name = 'Josh Perez';<br>
            const element = &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {name}&lt;/h1&gt;;<br>
            </code>
            <p>You can put any valid JavaScript expression inside the curly braces in JSX. For example, <span
                    class="yellow">2 + 2</span>,
                <span class="yellow">user.firstName</span>,
                or <span class="yellow">formatName(user)</span> are all valid JavaScript expressions.<br>
            </p>

            <p>In the example below, we embed the result of calling a JavaScript function, <span
                    class="yellow">formatName(user)</span>,
                into an <span class="yellow">&lt;h1&gt;</span> element.</p>

            <code>
                function formatName(user) {<br>
                    &emsp;return user.firstName + ' ' + user.lastName;<br>
                }<br>
                <br>
                const user = {<br>
                    &emsp;firstName: 'Harper',<br>
                    &emsp;lastName: 'Perez'<br>
                };<br>
                <br>
                const element = ( <br>
                &emsp;&lt;h1&gt;<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;Hello, {formatName(user)}!<br>
                &emsp;&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
                );<br>
                <br>
            </code>
